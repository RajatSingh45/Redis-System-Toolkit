## 🧠 About The Project

Modern backend systems don’t just store data — they manage authentication, security, traffic control, distributed consistency & async processing.

This project was built to **learn & demonstrate backend system architecture using Redis as the core infrastructure layer.**

It acts like a **mini API-Gateway + Job Processor**, inspired by platforms like Stripe, Uber & Slack.

## 🏗 System Architecture

This project follows an **API Gateway Architecture**.  
All client requests go through a central gateway (Express server). Redis acts as the core infrastructure layer powering authentication, rate-limiting, session storage, async queues, and leaderboard ranking. Background workers process jobs independently.

```


## 🔑 API Key Authentication Flow

Client authentication is enforced via API Keys. Keys are hashed and stored in Redis. Each request contains the key in headers.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant G as API Gateway
    participant R as Redis

    C->>G: Sends request with x-api-key
    G->>R: Hash API Key & Validate
    R-->>G: Return clientId if valid
    alt Key Valid
        G-->>C: Allow request
    else Invalid
        G-->>C: 401 Unauthorized
    end
```

## 🚦 Rate Limiting — Token Bucket

The system prevents abuse using Token Bucket rate-limit strategy.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Request Arrives] --> B[Identify Client]
    B --> C[Fetch Bucket From Redis]
    C --> D{Enough Tokens?}

    D -- Yes --> E[Allow Request]
    E --> F[Decrease Token Count]
    F --> G[Store Updated Token Count]

    D -- No --> H[Reject Request - 429]
    
    G --> I[Refill Tokens Over Time]
```

## 🔒 Distributed Lock Flow

Used to prevent race conditions such as rotating API keys simultaneously from multiple servers.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S1 as Server-1
    participant S2 as Server-2
    participant R as Redis

    S1->>R: SET lock:key NX EX 10
    R-->>S1: Lock Acquired
    S2->>R: SET lock:key NX EX 10
    R-->>S2: Lock Denied
    S1->>R: Perform Critical Update
    S1->>R: DEL lock:key
    R-->>S2: Lock Available Now
```

## 🔐 Session Storage Flow

Sessions are stored in Redis instead of JWT-only auth.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Login] --> B[Create Session]
    B --> C[Store in Redis<br/>session:userId]
    C --> D[Return Session Token]

    E[User Request] --> F[Send Session Token]
    F --> G[Validate Against Redis]
    G -->|Valid| H[Allow Access]
    G -->|Invalid| I[Reject Request]
```

## 🏆 Leaderboard Ranking Flow

Leaderboard uses Redis Sorted Sets.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Player Score Update] --> B[ZADD leaderboard score userId]
    B --> C[Redis Sorts by Score]

    D[Top N Fetch] --> E[ZRANGE leaderboard 0 N WITHSCORES]

    F[User Rank Request] --> G[ZRANK leaderboard userId]
```

## 📬 Job Queue & Worker System

Jobs are processed in background without blocking API responses.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[Enqueue Job<br/>LPUSH queue:jobs]
    B --> C[Redis Stores Job]

    D[Worker Running] --> E[BRPOP queue:jobs]
    E --> F[Job Retrieved]

    F --> G{Success?}

    G -- Yes --> H[Mark Completed]

    G -- No --> I[Retry Count +1]
    I --> J{Retries > Max?}

    J -- Yes --> K[Move to Dead Letter Queue]
    J -- No --> B[Requeue Job]
```

## ⚠ Error Handling Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Incoming Request] --> B[Validate API Key]
    B -->|Fail| C[401 Unauthorized]

    B -->|Pass| D[Rate Limit Check]
    D -->|Fail| E[429 Too Many Requests]

    D -->|Pass| F[Business Logic Execution]
    
    F -->|Error| G[Log + 500 Response]
    F -->|Success| H[200 OK]

## 🧪 Postman Testing (Screenshots + Notes)

**Create Client**
![Create Client](./Gateway//src/assests/New_Client.png)
- This screenshot demonstrates the Client Registration API, where a new client registers using an ID and name. Once the request is processed, Redis stores the client metadata and a secure API key is generated and returned in the response. This API key is required to authenticate and access protected routes in the system. This onboarding flow is similar to how real-world APIs like Stripe, Razorpay, or GitHub issue API credentials to users.

**Authorized Request**
![Autherized Request](./Gateway//src//assests//Autherized_Key_Rotation.png)
- This screenshot shows the API Key Rotation feature, where an authenticated client can request a new API key. The request is authorized using the existing API key, and the system issues a fresh key while invalidating the previous one. Key rotation is a widely-used security practice in production systems to prevent long-term key exposure and reduce security risks.

**Rate Limit Trigger**
![Rate Limit Triger](./Gateway//src/assests/Rate_Limit.png)
- Here, the same API endpoint is called multiple times rapidly. Once the configured request quota is exceeded, the system responds with **429 Too Many Requests** along with a retryAfter value indicating when the next request is allowed. This demonstrates the Rate Limiting middleware powered by Redis, which protects APIs from spam, bot traffic, misuse, and accidental overload — similar to production systems like API gateways and cloud platforms.

**Leaderboard Ranking**
![LeaderBoard Rating](./Gateway//src/assests/Leaderboard.png)
- This screenshot demonstrates the Leaderboard API, which uses Redis Sorted Sets to maintain a ranked scoreboard. Users are sorted automatically based on scores, and the API supports pagination for efficient retrieval. This design is commonly used in gaming platforms, learning portals, fitness apps, and social engagement dashboards where real-time ranking performance is critical.

**Job Queue Enqueue**
![Job Queue Enqueue](./Gateway//src/assests/20_Enqueu_Job_Single_Time.png)
- In this screenshot, the Postman Runner is used to enqueue multiple jobs in bulk. Redis queues all incoming jobs efficiently, and the worker processes them asynchronously in the background. This confirms that the system can handle load without blocking API responses, providing scalability, message durability, and reliable background execution — key requirements in distributed systems.

![Job Queue Enqueue](./Gateway//src/assests/Enqueue_Job_Trminal.png)
- This screenshot shows the Worker Service consuming and processing background jobs from the Redis-based Job Queue. Each job represents an email task, and some jobs intentionally fail to simulate real system errors. Failed jobs are automatically retried, and jobs that exceed the retry limit are safely moved into a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ). This pattern mirrors systems like AWS SQS, BullMQ, Celery, and Kafka-based job processing.
